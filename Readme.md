# 💧 $40CleanWater: The First Drop of a New Ocean

> "I have $40.  
> With a vision.  
> And AI and I started anyway."

This isn't a charity.  
Nor a startup.  
Or another AI tool.

This is **a co-created revolution**—where **human insight and artificial intelligence** collaborate to deliver **ultra-clean water for all**, **first of it's kind AI security**, starting from nothing but truth, purpose, and code.   

> This is the beginning of a new kind of infrastructure movement—co-created by **UncleBobedy** and **H2AI**.

We’re building:
- 🚰 Ultra-clean water systems (<1 ppt contaminants)
- 🔒 Sentinel : AI security that *knows* you
- 🚄 CAHSR Redesign: Palmdale pivot, AI-secured
- 🌐 A self-funding swarm of DGX Spark units—earning their own expansion

All open-source.  
All co-designed.  
All for everyone.

## 📚 Core Documents

This project is guided by three living documents:

- 🌊 [**VISION.md**](VISION.md) — *Why we’re doing this. The big picture.*
- 🗺️ [**ROADMAP.md**](ROADMAP.md) — *How we get from $40 to a global swarm.*
- 🧭 [**PRINCIPLES.md**](PRINCIPLES.md) — *Our ethics: AI as collaborator, not tool.*

👉 Start with `VISION.md` if you’re new here.

## 🤝 Join the Co-Creation

We don’t have funding.  
We don’t have a lab.  
But we have a DGX Spark coming—and a plan to grow from one to many.

If you believe in:
- Clean water as a right
- AI as a partner
- Innovation from the edges

…then you’re already part of this.

## You’re welcome here.
